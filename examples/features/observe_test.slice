  1. Sample x from uniform(0.0, 1.0)
  2. Observe that x < 0.5
     - If x >= 0.5 (50% chance), this causes an ObserveFailure.
  3. If observe passes (x < 0.5), return the boolean (x < 0.2)
     - Given x is in [0, 0.5), P(x < 0.2) is 0.2/0.5 = 0.4.
     - So, 40% of non-failing runs should be true.
     - And 60% of non-failing runs should be false.

  Overall for N runs:
  - ~0.5 * N ObserveFailures
  - ~0.5 * N * 0.4 = 0.2 * N True results
  - ~0.5 * N * 0.6 = 0.3 * N False results
