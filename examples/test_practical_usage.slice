(* Practical example: Age verification system *)
(* Shows natural usage of greater than operators in a real scenario *)

let age = uniform(0.0, 100.0) in
let voting_age = 18.0 in
let retirement_age = 65.0 in

(* Natural way to write age checks *)
let can_vote = age >= voting_age in      (* Desugars to: voting_age <= age *)
let is_senior = age > retirement_age in  (* Desugars to: retirement_age < age *)
let is_adult = age >= 18.0 in           (* Desugars to: 18.0 <= age *)

(* Discrete example: Game level system *)
let player_level = 7#10 in
let boss_level = 8#10 in
let min_level = 5#10 in

(* Natural comparisons for game logic *)
let strong_enough = player_level >#10 min_level in    (* Desugars to: min_level <#10 player_level *)
let ready_for_boss = player_level >=#10 boss_level in (* Desugars to: boss_level <=#10 player_level *)

(* Complex condition *)
let game_complete = if is_adult && strong_enough then 
                      ready_for_boss 
                    else 
                      false in

can_vote && is_senior && is_adult && strong_enough && ready_for_boss && game_complete
