(* Test demonstrating equivalence between greater than syntax *)
(* and manually written flipped less than syntax *)

let x = 5.0 in
let y = 3.0 in

(* Using greater than syntax (gets desugared) *)
let gt_desugared = x > y in
let gte_desugared = x >= y in

(* Using manually flipped less than syntax *)
let gt_manual = y < x in
let gte_manual = y <= x in

(* Same test with finite comparisons *)
let a = 3#7 in
let b = 1#7 in

let fin_gt_desugared = a >#7 b in
let fin_gte_desugared = a >=#7 b in

let fin_gt_manual = b <#7 a in
let fin_gte_manual = b <=#7 a in

(* All comparisons should produce the same logical results *)
(* The desugared and manual versions should behave identically *)
gt_desugared && gte_desugared && gt_manual && gte_manual && 
fin_gt_desugared && fin_gte_desugared && fin_gt_manual && fin_gte_manual
