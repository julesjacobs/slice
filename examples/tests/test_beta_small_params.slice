(* Test Beta distribution with very small positive parameters *)
let alpha_val = 0.0000001 in (* very small positive alpha *)
let beta_val = 0.0000001 in  (* very small positive beta *)

(* Define the beta distribution *)
let x = beta(alpha_val, beta_val) in

(* Perform a comparison.
   The focus is on whether the small parameters cause issues during
   discretization (CDF calculation) or sampling (interpreter).
   Expected behavior is that it runs, but we're probing for crashes or NaNs. *)
