Probabilistic programming languages are a powerful tool for statistical modeling, but performing exact inference on programs with continuous random variables remains a major challenge. This paper presents \Slice{}, a language that enables exact inference for a broad class of programs with continuous distributions. \Slice{} works by automatically and soundly discretizing continuous variables. The core of our approach is a novel type system that analyzes how continuous random variables are compared within a program. It uses this information to partition the continuous domains into a finite number of intervals, transforming the original program into an equivalent, purely discrete one. This transformed program can then be solved by a backend exact inference engine for discrete PPLs. We formalize this type-directed discretization, prove its soundness, and provide an open-source implementation. Our evaluation shows that our approach is significantly faster than existing symbolic inference techniques for hybrid discrete-continuous programs, bridging the gap between expressive continuous modeling and the power of exact discrete inference.
