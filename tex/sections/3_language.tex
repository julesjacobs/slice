\section{The Slice Language and Type System}\label{sec:language}

\input{figures/grammar}

The syntax of the \Slice{} language is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grammar}.
Beyond basic functional constructs, the language includes the following constructs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Finite types}: Values of the form $\finconst{k}{n}$ represent finite type constants, where $k$ is a value in the finite type with $n$ elements.
\item \textbf{Discrete distributions}: The $\discrete(p_0, \ldots, p_{n-1})$ construct returns a random value in the finite type with $n$ elements.
\item \textbf{Continuous distributions}: The implementation supports distributions including uniform, Gaussian, exponential, beta, gamma, Laplace, Cauchy, and others.
\item \textbf{Observations}: The $\text{observe}(e)$ construct conditions the program on a boolean expression $e$ being true.
\item \textbf{Other features}: Features such as lists, recursion, and mutable references are supported.
\end{itemize}

When we discretize continuous programs, we convert expressions involving continuous distributions into expressions with discrete distributions over the corresponding finite type, and convert less-than comparisons into less-than-or-equal comparisons on the corresponding discrete values.

\subsection{Type System}\label{sec:type-system}

We introduce a type system that analyzes both the comparison points and concrete values of floating point expressions. We have the following types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard types: $\textbf{int}$, $\textbf{bool}$, $\tau_1 * \tau_2$, $\tau_1 \rightarrow \tau_2$, $\textbf{unit}$, $\textbf{list}(\tau)$, $\textbf{ref}(\tau)$, etc.
    \item $\fin{n}$: finite type with values $\{\finconst{0}{n}, \finconst{1}{n}, \ldots, \finconst{(n-1)}{n}\}$
    \item \float$[B; V]$: floating point type with comparison bounds $B$ and value set $V$ that are elements of the lattice structure described below.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Lattice Structure.} 
We use a join-semilattice with the following structure, given a domain $D$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Elements: $\{\text{Finite}(S) \mid S \text{ is a finite set over } D\} \cup \{\top\}$
    \item Ordering: $\text{Finite}(S_1) \sqsubseteq \text{Finite}(S_2)$ if $S_1 \subseteq S_2$, and $x \sqsubseteq \top$ for any $x$
    \item Join: $\text{Finite}(S_1) \sqcup \text{Finite}(S_2) = \text{Finite}(S_1 \cup S_2)$, and $x \sqcup \top = \top$ for any $x$
    \item Bottom: $\text{Finite}(\emptyset)$
    \item Top: $\top$
\end{itemize}

In $\float$[B; V], $V$ is a lattice element with domain $\R$, and $B$ is a lattice element with domain $<\!\!x$ and $\leq\!\!x$ for all $x \in \R$.
The lattice structure enables type inference to systematically collect and propagate information about both how values are used (bounds) and what values they can take (values).

The typing rules are split into two parts: rules specific to float types and continuous distributions (Figure~\ref{fig:typing-float}), and standard rules for all other language constructs (Figure~\ref{fig:typing-general}).

To understand the float typing rules, it is helpful to understand how discretization works.
A type $\float$[B; V] is discretized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $B$ is a finite set of bounds, then the type is discretized to a type $\fin{(n+1)}$ where $n$ is the number of bounds. For instance, if $B = \{<\!\!0.5, \leq\!\!0.8\}$, then the type is discretized to $\fin{3}$, where $\finconst{0}{3}$ represents the range $(-\infty, 0.5)$, $\finconst{1}{3}$ represents the range $[0.5, 0.8]$, and $\finconst{2}{3}$ represents the range $(0.8, \infty)$.
    \item If $B = \top$, then no discretization is performed, and the type remains $\float$.
\end{itemize}

To understand the typing rules, keep in mind that the $B$ set needs to be sufficiently refined (i.e., contain enough comparison points) so that the discretized program has enough information to determine how the original continuous program behaved.

\paragraph{Continuous distributions.} Let us first consider the typing rule for single-argument continuous distributions.
The rule states that the argument $\Gamma \vdash e : \float[B; V]$ with the constraint that $B$ distinguishes $V$. The distinguishes predicate is defined as follows:
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:distinguishes}
    $B$ distinguishes $V$ if every interval in $B$ contains at most one value in $V$, or $B = \top$.
\end{definition}
Intuitively $V$ contains the possible values that the float expression can take on, and $B$ distinguishes $V$ if the continuous quantity can be fully recovered by the discretized program.
For example, if $B = \{<\!\!0.5, \leq\!\!0.8\}$ and $V = \{0.2, 0.7\}$, then $B$ distinguishes $V$. The intervals induced by $B$ are $(-\infty, 0.5)$, $[0.5, 0.8]$, and $(0.8, \infty)$. The first interval contains $0.2$, the second contains $0.7$, and the third contains no values from $V$, so the condition holds. In contrast, if $V = \{0.2, 0.3\}$, $B$ would not distinguish $V$ because both values lie in the first interval $(-\infty, 0.5)$.

Note that if $e$ is a constant, then $V = \{e\}$ and $B = \emptyset$ distinguishes $V$ (because $V$ is a singleton set, so there are no two elements that could lie in the same interval).
If $V = \top$ then $V$ essentially contains all possible real values, so we must also have $B = \top$ in that case.

The rule for two-argument continuous distributions is similar, but the argument $\Gamma \vdash e_1 : \float[B_1; V_1]$ and $\Gamma \vdash e_2 : \float[B_2; V_2]$ with the constraint that $B_1$ and $B_2$ distinguish $V_1$ and $V_2$ respectively.



\paragraph{Comparisons.} 
To understand the typing rules for less-than and less-than-or-equal comparisons, let us first consider a comparison $e < c$ where $c$ is a constant and $e$ is a continuously ranging quantity. Intuitively, if $e : \float[B_1; V_1]$ is discretized, then it must still contain enough information to determine whether $e < c$ is true or false. Therefore, $B_1$ must contain the comparison $<\!\!c$.

Similarly, if $c$ is not a literal constant, but has type $c : \float[B_2; V_2]$, then $c$ can take on values in $V_2$. Therefore, if $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ then $B_1$ must contain the comparisons $<\!\!v_1, <\!\!v_2, \dots, <\!\!v_n$. This motivates the following definition:

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:answers-less}
    $B$ answers $<\!\!V$ if $B$ contains comparisons $<\!\!v$ for every $v \in V$, or $B = \top$.
\end{definition}

In the case that $B = \top$, the quantity is not discretized, so the comparison remains continuous.

Lastly, in order to be able to perform the comparison on the discrete values, we insist that $B_1 = B_2$, ensuring that $e$ and $c$ are discretized to the same representation, and $<$ can be discretized to $\finleq{k}$.

It can also be the case that we have a comparison $c < e$ where the continuously ranging quantity $e : \float[B_2; V_2]$ is on the right hand side. In this case, $B_2$ must answer $c\!\!<$, that is, it must contain a comparison $\leq\!\!c$. To make this explicit, consider $2.3 < e$. We can answer this precisely when $B_2$ contains an intervals $(-\infty, 2.3]$ and $(2.3, +\infty)$: the comparison $2.3 < e$ is true if $e$ is in the second interval, and false if $e$ is in the first interval. Of course, it is also ok if $B_2$ is even more precise, as long as it contains the comparison $\leq\!\!2.3$.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:answers-less-equal}
    $B$ answers $\leq\!\!V$ if $B$ contains comparisons $\leq\!\!v$ for every $v \in V$, or $B = \top$.
\end{definition}

For less-than-or-equal comparisons, the typing rule is similar, but with the conditions reversed.

The typing rules for the other constructs are standard, and are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:typing-general}.
